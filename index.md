					<h3>Hello</h3>

				<p class="p-r">My name is Renat and this is my personal project as a contract Ruby developer. Ruby is certainly not dead and I love the language and have had the pleasure of working with it for over 10 years. Recently a fresh version 3 of the language came out. The Ruby on Rails framework is evolving and bringing its innovations. Below you can find a description of how I can be useful to you and how I can apply my huge baggage of experience in your company.</p>

    					<h3>What can I do for you?</h3>

                    <p>My specialty is reviving old Ruby on Rails projects. For more than 10 years I've been updating and maintaining legacy code.</p>

                    <p>My work includes</p>
                    <ul>                
                        <li>updating framework versions</li>
                        <li>updating libraries</li>
                        <li>rewriting old/legacy code</li>
                        <li>migrating to new databases</li>
                        <li>covering tests</li>
                        <li>rewriting CoffeeScript code to modern JavaScript</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The basic idea is that you hire me as an Independent Contractor and I fully immerse myself in your project, do an initial review of problem areas, cover missing code with tests, and do updates and maintenance of current code.</p>
                    
                    <p>The whole job can take anywhere from 6-8 weeks (depends on the project) to as long as you need and enjoy working with me.</p>
                    
                    <p>The price of my work is fixed and is only $10,000 USD for 4 weeks of perfect work.</p>
